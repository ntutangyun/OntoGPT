I have a road driving scenario ontology as below (in DOT format).

digraph Ontology {
graph [rankdir = LR];
Scenario -> Environment;
Scenario -> Infrastructure;
Scenario -> Participants;
Environment -> Weather;
Environment -> Lighting;
Environment -> AirQuality;
Infrastructure -> RoadType;
Infrastructure -> RoadObjects;
Infrastructure -> RoadFurniture;
Infrastructure -> RoadCondition;
Infrastructure -> RoadMarkings;
RoadType -> Highway;
RoadType -> CityStreet;
RoadType -> RuralRoad;
RoadObjects -> Barrier;
RoadObjects -> Guardrail;
RoadObjects -> Pothole;
RoadObjects -> Debris;
RoadFurniture -> Sign;
RoadFurniture -> TrafficLight;
RoadFurniture -> Roundabout;
RoadCondition -> Slippery;
RoadCondition -> Uneven;
Participants -> Driver;
Participants -> Vehicle;
Participants -> Pedestrian;
Driver -> Aggressive;
Driver -> Defensive;
Driver -> Impaired;
Driver -> Inexperienced;
Impaired -> DrunkDriving;
Impaired -> DistractedDriving;
Inexperienced -> Learner;
Inexperienced -> ElderlyDriver;
Vehicle -> Car;
Vehicle -> Motorcycle;
Vehicle -> Truck;
Vehicle -> Bus;
Vehicle -> Emergency;
Emergency -> Ambulance;
Emergency -> FireTruck;
Emergency -> PoliceCar;
Pedestrian -> Human;
Pedestrian -> Animal;
Pedestrian -> Bicyclist;
RoadMarkings -> LaneLines;

RoadMarkings -> StopLines;
Sign -> RegulatorySign;
Sign -> WarningSign;
Sign -> InformationalSign;
RegulatorySign -> SpeedLimitSign;
WarningSign -> DeerCrossingSign;
InformationalSign -> ExitSign;
}

In the ontology context, list all possible relationships (predicates) between Car (subject) and Car (object):
Do not involve new concepts other than Car as the subject and Car as the object.

Format your responses in lines of the following format:
@ subject -> predicate -> object.
Start each line with @.
For example, @ Vehicle -> Drives on -> Road
