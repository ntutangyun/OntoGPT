I have a road driving scenario ontology as below (in DOT format).

digraph Ontology {
graph [rankdir = LR];
Scenario -> Environment;

Environment -> AirQuality;
Infrastructure -> RoadType;
Infrastructure -> RoadObjects;

}

In the ontology context, list all possible relationships (predicates) between FireTruck (subject) and TrafficLight (object):
Do not involve new concepts other than FireTruck as the subject and TrafficLight as the object.

Format your responses in lines of the following format:
@ subject -> predicate -> object.
Start each line with @.
For example, @ Vehicle -> Drives on -> Road

                Response
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
@ FireTruck -> Approaches -> TrafficLight.
@ FireTruck -> Stops at -> TrafficLight.
@ FireTruck -> Ignores -> TrafficLight.
@ FireTruck -> Affects -> TrafficLight (e.g. changes the light to green through an emergency signal).
