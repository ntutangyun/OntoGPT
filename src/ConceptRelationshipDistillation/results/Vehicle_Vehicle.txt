I have a road driving scenario ontology as below (in DOT format).

digraph Ontology {
graph [rankdir = LR];
Scenario -> Environment;
Scenario -> Infrastructure;
Scenario -> Participants;
Environment -> Weather;
Environment -> Lighting;
Environment -> AirQuality;
Infrastructure -> RoadType;
Infrastructure -> RoadObjects;
Infrastructure -> RoadFurniture;
Infrastructure -> RoadCondition;
Infrastructure -> RoadMarkings;
RoadType -> Highway;
RoadType -> CityStreet;
RoadType -> RuralRoad;
RoadObjects -> Barrier;
RoadObjects -> Guardrail;
RoadObjects -> Pothole;
RoadObjects -> Debris;
RoadFurniture -> Sign;
RoadFurniture -> TrafficLight;
RoadFurniture -> Roundabout;
RoadCondition -> Slippery;
RoadCondition -> Uneven;

RoadMarkings -> StopLines;
Sign -> RegulatorySign;
Sign -> WarningSign;

}

In the ontology context, list all possible relationships (predicates) between Vehicle (subject) and Vehicle (object):
Do not involve new concepts other than Vehicle as the subject and Vehicle as the object.

Format your responses in lines of the following format:
@ subject -> predicate -> object.
Start each line with @.
For example, @ Vehicle -> Drives on -> Road
