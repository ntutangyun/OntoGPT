@HeavyRain@ Heavy rain is a meteorological condition where a significant amount of rain falls in a short period of time. It can lead to reduced visibility, slippery road conditions, and potential flooding.@

@LightSnow@ Light snow refers to a gentle and thin layer of frozen precipitation that accumulates on the ground. It can cause road surfaces to become slippery, especially when it melts and refreezes.@

@Blizzards@ Blizzards are severe winter weather events characterized by heavy snowfall, strong winds, and reduced visibility due to blowing snow. They can create treacherous driving conditions and lead to road closures.@

@RedLight@ A red traffic light is a signal displayed at intersections to indicate that vehicles and pedestrians must come to a complete stop. It's a crucial aspect of traffic control to manage the flow of vehicles and ensure safety.@

@GreenLight@ A green traffic light is a signal displayed at intersections to indicate that vehicles and pedestrians are allowed to proceed. It signals the right of way for vehicles in the direction of the green signal.@

@YellowLight@ A yellow traffic light, also known as an amber light, is a signal displayed at intersections to warn that the signal is about to change from green to red. It prompts drivers to slow down and prepare to stop.@

@Light@ In the context of weather intensity, "light" refers to a mild or gentle level of a weather condition. For example, light rain indicates a relatively low amount of rainfall.@

@Moderate@ In the context of weather intensity, "moderate" indicates a middle-level intensity of a weather condition. For instance, moderate snowfall indicates a moderate amount of snow accumulating on the ground.@

@Heavy@ In the context of weather intensity, "heavy" signifies a high or intense level of a weather condition. For example, heavy rain refers to a substantial amount of rain falling in a given period.@

@ ElectricVehicle @ An electric vehicle (EV) is a type of vehicle that operates using one or more electric motors powered by electricity stored in batteries. It does not rely on internal combustion engines and does not produce tailpipe emissions. Electric vehicles can include various types such as electric cars, electric trucks, electric buses, and electric motorcycles. They contribute to reducing air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels, promoting sustainability in transportation.@

@ AutonomousVehicle @ An autonomous vehicle, also known as a self-driving car or driverless car, is a vehicle that can operate and navigate without direct human input. Autonomous vehicles utilize various technologies such as sensors, cameras, radar, Lidar, and advanced artificial intelligence to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and control their movement. They can perform tasks like lane changing, braking, acceleration, and navigating complex traffic situations without requiring constant human intervention. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to enhance road safety, improve traffic efficiency, and provide mobility solutions for individuals who cannot drive.@
